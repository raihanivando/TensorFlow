# TensorFlow in Action

![TensorFlow in Action cover](Cover.PNG)

This repository contains my personal chapter-by-chapter notes and experiments based on **_TensorFlow in Action_ by Thushan Ganegedara**.[file:1] The book is a practical, end-to-end guide to TensorFlow 2: from core tensors and Keras APIs to advanced deep learning architectures and production deployment with TensorBoard and TFX.[file:1] These notes are written in my own words to help me review concepts, remember key ideas, and quickly revisit important TensorFlow patterns without always reopening the book.[file:1]

- Chapter 1: The amazing world of TensorFlow  
- Chapter 2: TensorFlow 2  
- Chapter 3: Keras and data retrieval in TensorFlow 2  
- Chapter 4: Dipping toes in deep learning  
- Chapter 5: State-of-the-art in deep learning: Transformers[file:1]

**Part 2 – “Look Ma, No Hands!” Deep Networks in the Real World**

- Chapter 6: Teaching machines to see – Image classification with CNNs  
- Chapter 7: Teaching machines to see better – Improving CNNs and making them confess  
- Chapter 8: Telling things apart – Image segmentation  
- Chapter 9: Natural language processing with TensorFlow – Sentiment analysis  
- Chapter 10: Natural language processing with TensorFlow – Language modeling[file:1]

**Part 3 – Advanced Deep Networks for Complex Problems**

- Chapter 11: Sequence-to-sequence learning – Part 1  
- Chapter 12: Sequence-to-sequence learning – Part 2  
- Chapter 13: Transformers  
- Chapter 14: TensorBoard – Big brother of TensorFlow  
- Chapter 15: TFX – MLOps and deploying models with TensorFlow[file:1]

## Core Topics Covered in the Book

The book walks through a wide range of TensorFlow 2 and deep learning topics, including:[file:1]

- **TensorFlow 2 and Keras basics**  
  - Tensors, variables, operations, and eager execution  
  - Keras model-building APIs (Sequential, Functional, subclassing)  
  - Input pipelines with `tf.data`, Keras generators, and `tensorflow-datasets`[file:1]

- **Deep learning architectures**  
  - Fully connected networks and autoencoders  
  - Convolutional neural networks for image classification and segmentation  
  - Recurrent neural networks and sequence models  
  - Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms[file:1]

- **Real-world ML tasks**  
  - Image classification and Inception-style CNNs  
  - Image segmentation with DeepLab-style models  
  - Sentiment analysis and language modeling in NLP  
  - Sequence-to-sequence translation and Transformer-based applications[file:1]

- **Monitoring and production**  
  - TensorBoard for visualization, monitoring, and profiling  
  - Building ML pipelines with TFX  
  - Model evaluation, serving, and deployment via APIs and serving infrastructure[file:1]

## What This Repo Contains

- Per-chapter Markdown summaries (starting with Part 1, Chapters 1–5), written as study notes rather than full reproductions of the book.  
- Pointers to important figures (by label, e.g., `[Figure 4.4]`) that I capture from my own copy of the book for personal reference.[file:1]  
- Optionally, small code snippets or experiment notes inspired by the examples, adapted to my own TensorFlow 2 workflows.

This repository is **not** a replacement for the original book.[file:1] It is a learning log that documents what I have understood from *TensorFlow in Action* and supports future projects using TensorFlow 2.[file:1]
